# 🧠 Interactive Financial Literacy Simulator

> Learn finance by making decisions — not by memorizing definitions.

An **interactive, simulation-driven financial literacy platform** designed to help users understand real-world economic and financial concepts through hands-on decision-making scenarios.

This project explores how **technology, cryptography, and decentralized systems** can be used to explain *why* financial systems work the way they do — rather than just *how* to use them.

## 🚧 Project Status: Active Development

⚠️ **This project is currently under active development.**

- 🛠️ Ongoing implementation and iteration  
- 🏁 **Hackathon submission deadline:** **March 2026**
- ✨ Features, UI, and simulations are evolving continuously

The current version represents a **working prototype**, not the final product.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Financial systems are often treated as opaque, intimidating, or purely theoretical.  
This project aims to:

- Bridge the gap between **theory and real-world application**
- Replace passive learning with **interactive simulations**
- Help users intuitively understand:
  - Transactions & authorization
  - Trust, verification, and ownership
  - Centralized vs decentralized systems

---

## 🧩 Core Concept

Instead of reading about finance, users **simulate real scenarios**, such as:

- Asset ownership and transfers  
- Transaction authorization  
- Risk and decision trade-offs  
- Trust models (institution-based vs protocol-based)

Each simulation is designed to **visualize what normally remains invisible** in traditional financial systems.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack (Current & Planned)

### Frontend
- React / TypeScript
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive UI

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python)
- REST APIs for simulations & logic

### AI

### ✨ Final Note

This project is an exploration — not a claim of authority.  
The goal is **clarity, intuition, and understanding**, not complexity for its own sake.
