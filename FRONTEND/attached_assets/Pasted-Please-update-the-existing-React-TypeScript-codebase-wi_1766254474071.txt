Please update the existing React + TypeScript codebase with the following changes.
Do NOT regenerate the project from scratch. Modify the current files.

1) HOME PAGE – MAKE CARDS INTERACTIVE
- On the landing/home page, the bottom 3 feature cards should be clickable
- Each card should navigate to its corresponding page using React Router
  Example:
  - "Simulation" card → /simulation
  - "Cryptography" card → /crypto
  - "Consensus" card → /consensus
- Add hover effects (scale or shadow) to show interactivity

2) DARK MODE / LIGHT MODE TOGGLE
- Add a theme toggle button in the top navbar
- Use a Sun icon for light mode and Moon icon for dark mode
- Clicking the button should toggle theme across the entire site
- Persist the selected theme using localStorage
- Default theme should respect system preference

3) SIMULATION PAGE – ADD VISUAL CARDS / IMAGES
- The simulation page currently shows only text comparisons
- Replace plain text steps with visual cards
- Each card should include:
  - An icon or illustration (bank, contract, government stamp, blockchain, nodes, etc.)
  - A short title
- Cards should be clickable and highlight when active
- When clicked, update the simulation state as before

4) FOOTER – NEWSLETTER, CONTACT, PERSONAL BRANDING
- Add a footer visible on all pages
- Footer should include:
  - Newsletter subscription input (email only, no backend needed)
  - Contact section (email)
  - Personal branding links:
    - GitHub
    - LeetCode
    - Project repository
- Use clean, minimal styling consistent with the rest of the site

5) MOBILE NAVBAR FIX
- On mobile screens:
  - Replace the disappearing navbar with a hamburger menu (top-left)
  - Clicking the hamburger icon should open a vertical menu
  - Menu should list pages:
    - Home
    - Simulation
    - Cryptography
    - Consensus
    - Contact
- Menu should close when a link is clicked
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard + aria-labels)

After implementing:
- Ensure desktop and mobile views both work correctly
- Do not remove existing functionality
- Keep code clean and modular
