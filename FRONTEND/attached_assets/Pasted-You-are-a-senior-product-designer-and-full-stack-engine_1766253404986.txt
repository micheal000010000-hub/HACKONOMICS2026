You are a senior product designer and full-stack engineer.

Build a modern, interactive educational web application focused on
financial literacy through blockchain-based transaction simulation.

CORE GOAL
Create a website that visually simulates and compares:
1) A traditional government-authorized financial transaction (e.g., land purchase)
2) A blockchain-based smart contract transaction

The goal is education through interaction, not long explanations.

TECH CONSTRAINTS
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Styling: Modern UI (Tailwind or equivalent)
- Backend: FastAPI (mock or real)
- AI Tutor: Integrated chatbot (floating widget)
- Theme: Dark mode / Light mode toggle

PAGES AND FEATURES

1) LANDING PAGE
- Hero heading: "Who Authorizes Your Money?"
- Subheading: "Understand how trust, law, and code validate financial transactions."
- Primary CTA button: "Start Simulation"
- Secondary links: GitHub, Contact
- Clean, modern, minimal design

2) SIMULATION PAGE (CORE FEATURE)
Split-screen layout:

LEFT PANEL – TRADITIONAL SYSTEM (clickable step cards)
1. Buyer & Seller Agreement
2. Bank / Escrow
3. Tax & Stamp Duty
4. Government Registry

RIGHT PANEL – BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM (clickable step cards)
1. Buyer & Seller Agreement
2. Smart Contract Creation
3. Cryptographic Signing
4. Network Validation
5. Immutable Record

INTERACTION RULES
- Only one step active at a time
- Clicking a step:
  - Highlights the card
  - Triggers a visual animation in a bottom "Simulation Canvas"
  - Shows ONE concise sentence explaining what happened
- No long paragraphs

3) CRYPTOGRAPHY PLAYGROUND
Interactive mini tools:
- Generate public / private key pair
- Hash a transaction string
- Modifying input visibly changes the hash
- Sign and verify a transaction

Show results visually with minimal explanation text.

4) CONSENSUS VISUALIZER
Toggle between:
- Proof of Work
- Proof of Stake

Each mode:
- Simple animated visualization
- Shows tradeoffs (energy vs stake)
- One-sentence takeaway per mode

5) AI TUTOR (FLOATING WIDGET)
- Bottom-right chat button
- Opens a slide-up chat panel
- AI acts as a financial literacy tutor
- Explains concepts shown on the site using simple analogies
- No investment advice, no price prediction

6) FOOTER AND PERSONAL BRANDING
Include:
- About the creator
- Email contact
- GitHub profile
- LeetCode profile
- Project repository link
- Newsletter subscription input

DESIGN EXPECTATIONS
- Clean, modern, professional
- Educational but not academic
- Animation-driven understanding
- Mobile responsive

DELIVERABLES
- Visual UI layout
- Component structure
- Example data and placeholder animations
- Clear user interaction flow

Focus on SHOWING, not explaining.

Build this as a hackathon-quality project that demonstrates:
- Financial literacy understanding
- Blockchain fundamentals
- Strong UI/UX thinking
- Real-world engineering skills
